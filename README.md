# 🌱 Plant Disease Classification

## 📌 Overview
The **Plant Disease Classification** project leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to identify plant diseases from images.  
This innovative tool provides a **web application** where users can upload crop images and receive instant predictions, aiding farmers and agricultural experts in early disease detection.

## ✨ Features
- **🖼 Image Classification:** Utilizes a state-of-the-art CNN architecture to classify various plant diseases based on uploaded images.
- **⚡ Real-time Predictions:** Get immediate feedback on plant health, enabling timely interventions.
- **🌐 Web Interface:** A user-friendly **Flask** web application for easy image upload and prediction.
- **📈 Data Augmentation:** Improves model performance by expanding the training dataset with augmented images.
- **🔍 Visualization:** Displays class distribution and feature extraction results for better model interpretability.

## 📂 Dataset
The project is trained on the **[New Plant Diseases Dataset (Augmented)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset)** from Kaggle.  
This dataset includes a wide variety of images of healthy and diseased plants, organized into classes for different diseases.
